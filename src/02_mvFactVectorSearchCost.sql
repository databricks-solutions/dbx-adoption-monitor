-- mvFactVectorSearchCost — billing-only fact for Vector Search endpoint cost.
-- Stateless full rebuild each run over a bounded :lookback_days window.
-- Source: system.billing.usage where billing_origin_product = 'VECTOR_SEARCH'.
-- Grain: (endpoint_id, usage_date, workspace_id, sku_name). sku_name is in the grain
-- because a single endpoint can emit compute and storage SKUs on the same day.
-- Note: QPS/latency are not in system tables as of mid-2026; cost only.
--
-- Unattributed cost: some VECTOR_SEARCH billing lines carry real DBUs but no
-- usage_metadata.endpoint_id/endpoint_name — in practice the background index-maintenance
-- SKU (ENTERPRISE_JOBS_SERVERLESS_COMPUTE_*). These rows are KEPT (so the fact still
-- reconciles exactly to system.billing.usage) and endpoint_name is labelled
-- '(unattributed — index maintenance)' instead of surfacing as a NULL bucket in the
-- dashboard. endpoint_id stays NULL, so these rows group together per (date, workspace, sku).
